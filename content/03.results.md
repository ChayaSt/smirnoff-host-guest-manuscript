# Results and discussion

This results section is organized as follows. We first present a comparison of SMIRNOFF99Frosst and two iterations of the General Amber Force Field (GAFF [@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035]) force field on predicting binding free energies ($\Delta$G) and binding enthalpies ($\Delta$H) of small molecule guests to $\alpha$-cyclodextrin ($\alpha$CD) and $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD). Next, we detail how the behaviors of guest molecules changes between force fields and finally we summarize the parameter differences between SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF along with the effects of the parameter differences. 

## Binding free energies and enthalpies

SMIRNOFF99Frosst

Comparison of calculated absolute binding free energies ($\Delta$G) and binding enthalpies ($\Delta$H) with experiment with SMIRNOFF99Frosst parameters applied to both host and guest. The orange, blue, and purple coloring distinguish the functional group of the guest as an ammonium, alcohol, or carboxylate, respectively.

SMIRNOFF99Frosst does about as well as, or even better than GAFF v1.7, despite having far fewer numerical parameters. GAFF v2.1 has a large RMSE, but surprisingly strong correlation with the experimental data.

Both SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF v1.7 systematically underestimate the binding free energy for cyclic alcohols except for beta-cyclodextrin with cyclopentanol (b-cpe).

[@fig:GAFF-v1.7-vs-experiment]

Notably, SMIRNOFF99Frosst does better on $\alpha$CD than $\beta$CD ([@fig:alpha-vs-beta]).

SMIRNOFF99Frosst does a great job predicting the binding free energy of $\alpha$CD with alcohols, with four of the five points nearly falling on the line of identity.

Likewise, SMIRNOFF99Frosst does a great job with amines (?) with three of the four points falling nearly on the line of identity.

With $\beta$CD, on teh other hand, things are a little different: two of the three carboxylates are overestimated, ammoniums are great, but the alcohols are all over the place (two overestimated, two understimated.)

This difference is likely because... (?) of flexibility? (Is alpha more flexible than beta?)

Middle: to-view of the open cavity of $\beta$CD with no guest (200 snapshots over 1 $\mu$s). Bottom: side-view of the open cavity. The carbons are colored blue in SMIRNOFF99Frosst, green in GAFF v1.7, and purple in GAFF v2.1. Hydrogen atoms have been hidden for clarity. `Update font size in RMSD plots.` ](images/cyclodextrin-flexibility.png){#fig:flexibility width=100%}

## Guest preferences for primary and secondary binding

There are two orientations for binding: one where the primary functional group is interacting with the more narrow opening primary alcohols and one with the polar group oriented out of the wider, secondary opening.

The experimental data is a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of these two orientations.

## Structural insights
Next, we summarize the parameter differences between SMIRNOFF99Frosst, a decendent of parm@Frosst and GAFF v1.7 (released circa) and GAFF v2.1 (under active development).
