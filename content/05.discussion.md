## Discussion

[- It is striking that SMIRNOFF99Frosst does similarly to both GAFF force fields, despite having fewer parameters.
The necessity of adding each "type" of parameter for each atom type means that many parameters in GAFF are duplicates.
- But it is not clear which parameters can be pruned.
- SMIRNOFF99Frosst is a terse repesentation of a GAFF-like force field that is a good starting point for future development and optimization.
- How are we going to take this work forward?]{.lightgrey}
